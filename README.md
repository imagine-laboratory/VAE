# Variational Autoencoder for Aerial Agriculture

This repository contains implementations of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants and Autoencoders for learning compact representations from aerial drone imagery of agricultural fields. The models included aim to support applications such as precision agriculture, yield estimation, and field monitoring.

## Models Included
- **Autoencoder (AE)**
Standard encoder-decoder architecture for unsupervised representation learning.

- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**
Probabilistic model that learns latent distributions for input data.

- **Beta-VAE**
A VAE variant that introduces a Î² hyperparameter to control the disentanglement of latent variables.

- **Vector-Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE)**
A VAE variant that uses discrete latent codes with vector quantization.
